## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- SASS/SCSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned about the property grid-auto-flow, which was useful for styling the links in the footer. And I also found a useful tool to get the filter color in order to change a SVG image color on hover.

### Useful resources

- ["grid-auto-flow : CSS Grid :: flex-direction : Flexbox" by Robin Rendle, CSS-TRICKS](https://css-tricks.com/grid-auto-flow-css-grid-flex-direction-flexbox/) - This article explains how the property grid-auto-flow works; it is the GRID equivalent of flex-direction for FLEXBOX.
- ["CSS filter generator" by Barrett Sonntag](https://codepen.io/sosuke/pen/Pjoqqp) - Useful to obtain the filter for a hex color in order to change the color of an SVG image.
